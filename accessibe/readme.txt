Ensuring that your WordPress website is accessible to all visitors, including individuals with disabilities, is critical for a number of reasons.

But it’s important to realize that making your WordPress accessible and ADA-compliant greatly impacts its business potential.

**An accessible website allows you to appeal to a new audience base ([which commands trillions in annual expendable income](https://www.thevaluable500.com/press-release/the-valuable-500-releases-new-data-on-global-accessibility-awareness-day#:~:text=Disability%20is%20not%20a%20minority,when%20including%20friends%20and%20family.)), as well as to enhance your brand reputation.**
