Fix accessibility issues & make your site accessible with an AI-powered accessibility service.

== Description ==

accessWidget, accessiBe’s AI-powered accessibility plugin, helps your WordPress reach and maintain ADA compliance, in adherence to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). That way, you can expand your audience so that it accounts for members of the various disability communities - a group which consists of close to 29% of adult Americans, and win more business.

Following a quick and seamless installation process, accessWidget audits your WordPress website’s code, identifying accessibility barriers and swiftly remediating them. This allows people with various disabilities to access your website using assistive technology like screen readers, or by navigating solely through their keyboard.

Additionally, website visitors are presented with an interface through which they can adjust design and UI elements to better-fit their needs. Examples include stopping animations, increasing font sizes, and adjusting color contrasts, among many other options.

**accessWidget can help elevate any type of WordPress website, including those built with Elementor and Divi. Additionally, it can transform WooCommerce websites into accessible online stores.**

**You can explore accessWidget during a 7-day free trial; no credit card required**
